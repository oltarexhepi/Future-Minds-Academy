            Our senior developers offer 5 tips that are guaranteed to help any
            developer level up their skills.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              View coding as a hobby Top developers perceive coding as a hobby
              that they happen to get paid for. This mindset creates one of
              enjoyment and excitement. Those two feelings are going to make for
              a combination of someone who loves what they do and is excited
              every single day at the opportunity to dive deeper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Build side projects If you're not building side projects, then
              you're stuck working on something that someone else has instructed
              you to do. Having side projects is a habit for all great
              developers. The side projects don't have to be complete, shippable
              or even functional. It's about what you learn when building side
              projects and being able to explore new things.
            </li>
            <li>
              Think first, code second Have you ever watched a senior developer
              tackle solving a problem? Juniors will typically open their IDE
              right away and start looking at some files or writing code.
              Seniors will take their time. They'll grab pen and paper for some
              sketches. They'll open up a notepad to start jotting down some
              ideas. They'll Google some information they're needing to inform
              their decision. They'll write some pseudocode. Only once they are
              happy that they have planned out their approach, will they
              actually sit down and right the code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implement a checklist This is a simple but effective one: great
              seniors have the habit of going through their checklist before
              creating a pull request.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never stop learning It's no secret that what you know and
              understand right now will be outdated soon. We all have the
              responsibility to consistently keep learning, expanding our
              knowledge and staying up to date.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Build these 5 habits and you'll be a senior in no time at all.</p>

            The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common
            programming features that allow you to do things like:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for
              instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name
              in a variable called name.
            </li>
            <li>
              Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming).
              In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it
              to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g.
              "Player 1: Chris".
            </li>
            <li>
              Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web
              page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when
              the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text
              label.
            </li>
            <li>And much more!</li>

            <li>
              What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on
              top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application
              Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers
              to use in your JavaScript code.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a
            developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or
            impossible to implement.
